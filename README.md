## Latest Notification (12/18/2018)
Minor bugs fixed.

## Examples
To run the examples, please make sure that the library is in the correct relative path with respect to your modeling script, [PathSetup.m] will help you setup the library path profiles. Modify if necessary.

The current examples contains <Passive Walker>, <Quadruped> and <Swing Bar>:  Run [Modeling.m] for modeling process; Then run [Simulation.m] to see 3D simulation; 

## Past Notification (09/19/2018)
Algorithm refined to achieve significant efficiency improvement. Added the example of Quadruped.
