Copyright@RM-Lab.

Andy is a nonholonomic modeling toolbox for hybrid multibody dynamic systems.

Please contact jmechw@vt.edu for technical details.

## Examples
To run the examples, please make sure that the library is in the correct relative path with respect to your modeling script, [PathSetup.m] will help you setup the library path profiles. Modify if necessary.

The current examples contains <Passive Walker> and <Swing Bar>
  
For <Passive Walker>: Run [PassiveWalker_Simulation.m] if you are only interested in the 3D animation (Uncomment the PathSetup); Run [PassiveWalker_Modeling.m] only when you aer interested in the modeling process.

For <Swing>: Run Modeling and Simulation in [SwingBar.m].

## Updates
Future updates will be made consistantly.
